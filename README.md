# myCar

myCar is a website that aims to tackle organizational issues associated with your car(s). 

After users create an account and log in, myCar allows users to add one or more cars to their dashboard that they'd like to keep track of. On the right sidemenu of the dashboard the user can find upcoming events associated with their car(s). Events are things that happen to cars, including maintenance, accidents, or work the user personally performed on the car. 
Moreover, the Events page allows the user to add new events and provides a more detailed list of events. It separates all the events by past and future events, which allows the user to easily access information based on the event date. 

Our overall goal for myCar is to provide users with an optimal experience to organize and keep track of their vehicle(s) information.
